    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
    <p>
      When I started my journey through the Computer Science program at SNHU, rather than choosing to be a full-time student, I 
      chose to be a full-time student and a full-time employee. Balancing both work and school was one of the most challenging 
      experiences of my life. However, taking that challenge head on and finding creative ways to overcome it has significantly 
      improved my technical skills in software engineering and allowed me to develop interpersonal skills as a collaborator and 
      leader. In the workplace, I have learned to develop relationships with my peers, lead cross-functional teams, and use a 
      positive influence to foster collaboration and change. As a student, my experiences working with emerging technologies such 
      as machine learning and artificial intelligence have challenged me to critically assess technical problems and identify 
      efficient solutions. Additionally, I have developed skills focused on security, UX design, collaboration, and optimization 
      using multiple programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C++, HTML, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this ePortfolio, I will demonstrate my abilities in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and 
      databases by improving a full-stack application I previous developed in the Computer Science program at SNHU. The 
      enhancements to this project will showcase my ability to create a collaborative environment using innovative tools, a 
      security mindset, and my skills in full-stack development, UX design, and MVC routing architecture. Combining my technical 
      skills in computer science with my professional interpersonal skills focused on collaboration and leadership, I aim to 
      become a software developer who drives positive change in the environments around me.

      <p>
        For my enhancement in software design and engineering, I selected my Travlr Getaways full-stack web application 
        project for my artifact. I originally completed this project during CS-465 Full Stack Development using the MEAN stack. 
        The purpose of the initial project was to convert a static html page into a dynamic webpage and create an administrative 
        single-page application. Since only one page was originally created, I chose this project as my artifact as I would be 
        able to rapidly increase the scale and complexity of the project by converting the remaining 6 pages to dynamic webpages.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this specific category of enhancement, I focused on the front-end of the application. My enhancement plan was to 
        convert the static html pages to dynamic pages and utilize MVC routing architecture. Additionally, I would replace the 
        static data with dynamic loops using Handlebars and implement conditional formatting in the header and footer.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement my planned enhancements, I used the MVC routing architecture as a guide during development. For each page, 
        I first converted the static html file into a view. Then, for pages with static data that I would load dynamically with 
        handlebars, I created a temporary JSON data file. However, I didn’t remove the static data from the view at this point. 
        I then created a controller file for each page. For each page with data, I created functions to read the data from the 
        JSON file and passed it to the rendered view. Next, I created a route file for each page that implemented the controller. 
        With the basic MVC architecture implemented, I updated the app.js file to include the router files and implement the URLs 
        for each page. To finish my enhancements, I then updated the views to utilize Handlebars to dynamically load the data. I 
        replaced the static data with a loop that referenced the JSON data rather than hardcoded information. Additionally, I 
        replaced the header and footer with partials on each page. I also updated the header and footer to reference the new page 
        URLs and added conditional formatting. I added the conditional formatting by passing another Boolean value through the 
        render function in each controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        By utilizing tools such as Handlebars in addition to the MEAN stack to implement conditional formatting, I corrected an 
        existing issue within the application and further improved the user’s experience. The successful implementation of these 
        enhancements using innovative tools demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, MVC routing, and UX design while 
        also showcasing my ability to design and develop a collaborative environment. In addition, the clear and concise comments, 
        file structure, and naming conventions I used meet industry standards for documentation and cross-functional communication.

      <h3>Algorithms & Data Structures</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/benarobbins/CS-465/tree/module7" target="_blank" class="link-button">Original Code</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/benarobbins/CS-465/tree/Final" target="_blank" class="link-button">Enhanced Code</a>
      <p>
        For my enhancements in algorithms and data structures, I continued to use my Travlr Getaways full-stack web application 
        project as my artifact. This full-stack application project was initially completed using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, 
        Angular, and Node) for CS-465 Full Stack Development. The original project scope was to convert one static html page into a 
        dynamic webpage and to create an administrative single-page application. Both the client-side and back-end of the 
        application were developed for these requirements. I selected this artifact for this enhancement because only one page of 
        the application was originally developed. The remaining undeveloped pages provided multiple opportunities to demonstrate my 
        skills and ability to meet the course outcomes by increasing the scale and complexity of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement these enhancements, I planned to design and develop the APIs needed for the newly created pages of the 
        application to access and dynamically display data stored in the back end of the application. The APIs I planned to develop 
        would consist of methods to retrieve data (i.e., GET requests), add data (i.e., POST requests), and update existing data 
        (i.e., PUT requests). Additionally, I planned to implement security measures to protect the POST and PUT requests from 
        unauthenticated users by using JSON Web Tokens. These enhancements will demonstrate my skills and abilities in algorithms 
        and data structures and security best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement the APIs, I created a controller for the rooms, meals, and news pages. These APIs connected the front-end to 
        the back end of the application. In each controller, I created four methods; a GET method for all documents, a GET method 
        for a single document, a PUT method, and a POST method. Additionally, I implemented error handling to account for any 
        undefined behavior when attempting to retrieve the data. The methods were exported from the controller to be accessible to 
        the routes. I updated the existing index.js route file to import the newly created API controllers and define the URLs for 
        the APIs. To utilize the APIs in the application, I then had to update the controllers for the different pages of the 
        application. Rather than reading the data from a static JSON file, I updated the controller’s functions use the API 
        endpoint for GET requests and use the returned data in the dynamic display.
      </p>
      <p>
        In these enhancements, I have successfully designed and developed functional and efficient APIs that support the overall 
        goal of transitioning this static website into a series of dynamic webpages. Not only do these enhancements demonstrate my 
        ability to utilize algorithmic principles and best practices, but I have also demonstrated my ability to develop an 
        application using a security mindset. To maintain the integrity and security of the data stored in the external MongoDB 
        database, I implemented controls to protect the APIs that can alter or add data using JSON Web Tokens. The JSON Web Token 
        acts as an authentication security layer for the PUT and POST APIs. Each API function requires the user’s JSON Web Token to 
        be verified before any data is altered to prevent an unauthorized user from altering the data.

      <h3>Databases</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/benarobbins/CS-465/tree/module7" target="_blank" class="link-button">Original Code</a>
      <a href="https://github.com/benarobbins/CS-465/tree/Final" target="_blank" class="link-button">Enhanced Code</a>
      <p>
        For my final enhancement focusing on Databases, I continued to use my project from CS-465 Full Stack Development as my 
        artifact. The purpose of the project was to create a full-stack web application for a mock travel agency called Travlr 
        Getaways. For this project, I was tasked with converting a single stack html file into a dynamic webpage using the MEAN 
        stack and creating an administrative single page application (SPA). I selected this project as my artifact for this 
        enhancement due to its use of MongoDB. By expanding the scale and complexity of the application’s front-end, I would also 
        need to expand the back end of the application. In doing so, I can demonstrate my skills in NoSQL database deployment and 
        management.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this enhancement, my plan consisted of identifying the pages of the application that would dynamically display data 
        and then creating collections in MongoDB to store that data. Additionally, I would then define database schemas for each 
        new collection and integrate these with the APIs that I created for my second enhancement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After evaluating each page, I determined that the rooms, meals, and news pages would require new collections for data 
        storage. Using Mongoose, I then defined database schemas for each of the new collections. To do this, I identified the key 
        elements in the static html pages and added additional datapoints such as a code field. For each field that in the schemas, 
        I also defined the attributes for the fields such as the data type. For the code field specifically, I also added an index 
        to the field. Adding the index requirement to this field will increase the efficiency of the API calls that reference this 
        field. By utilizing this functionality in the schemas that I defined, not only do I demonstrate my skills in database 
        design and deployment, but I also continue to demonstrate my ability to use algorithmic principles to optimize the 
        performance of the application. To finalize this improvement to the APIs, I integrated the mongoose schemas into each 
        controller for the APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all three of my enhancements completed, I was able to begin testing the application as a whole rather than as 
        individual components. To do so, I utilized Postman to verify the integrity and functionality of the APIs. Additionally, I 
        ran the application locally to test the user interface of the completed application. The biggest challenge I encountered 
        was debugging errors across the application. With the increased size and scale of the application, debugging had the 
        potential to become time consuming to say the least. However, I was able to minimize the troubleshooting time by leveraging 
        the error messages I received in the PowerShell window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through these enhancements, I have demonstrated my skills in NoSQL database management and design, full stack development, 
        and troubleshooting and testing. These technical skills that I have developed show my ability to use innovative techniques 
        and tools to develop optimized applications. For example, by defining index elements within the database schemas, I 
        improved the efficiency of the APIs that I previously developed. Additionally, my evaluation of which pages require a 
        database collection further demonstrates my ability to assess problems and independently determine the most appropriate 
        and effective solution to implement. As with my previous enhancements, I also continued to use clear and concise comments 
        and naming conventions to clearly communicate the intent of the code and its function within the application.
